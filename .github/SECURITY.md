# ShellJS Security Policy

Thank you for reaching out regarding the security of the ShellJS module! Please
note that this project is maintained on a best-effort basis, however I still
intend to prioritize reviewing and addressing security issues.

## Supported Versions

I generally only support the latest ShellJS release (see
https://www.npmjs.com/package/shelljs). My goal is to release security fixes as
patch releases on top of whatever was most recently shipped.

If breaking changes have already landed on the main development branch, I may
apply the patch on the relevant release branch (ex.
[`0.8-release`](https://github.com/shelljs/shelljs/commits/0.8-release)) and
create a new release from there.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities to ntfschr@gmail.com. I should respond
within a few days. Although it's not strictly required, it helps me out if you
can include any proof of concept exploit code, suggested fix, etc.

**Please do not publicly disclose the suspected vulnerability** until I have a
chance to review your report. I'd like a chance to patch the code before the
issue is known to the public.

Please **only** use this email for security issues. It's also OK to use the
email if you're legitimately unsure if this is a security issue (better safe
than sorry). But for all other non-security issues, please use the GitHub issue
tracker.
